One of the most used features of PHP is its build-in webserver. I am heavily relying on it.
```
php -S localhost:8888
```

Since I try to aply docker to emulate a dev environment, I tried to figure out what the most easiest and lightweight way is to do the same with docker. Therefore I choose to use a precompiled php-alpine image from the official ([docker hub php page](https://hub.docker.com/_/php)).

My first working result was the following command that has to be executed in the folder where your code is:
```
docker run -dit --rm -v $(pwd):/home/www-data -p 8080:8080 --name simple-php-dev php:7-alpine "/bin/sh" -c "tail -f /dev/null"
```
Afterwards I start an interactive shell session, ...
```
docker exec -it simple-php-dev sh
```
... navigate to the volume directory ...
```
cd home/www-data/
```
... and boot up the php build-in webserver 
```
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
```
With this now it is possible to see the output in your hosts browser at ``` localhost:8080 ```
