## Github Authentications with tokens

Github recently informed me after I had pushed into my repo that:

> Basic authentication using a password to Git is deprecated and will soon no longer work. Visit https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information around suggested workarounds and removal dates.

So, my solution was to use SSH keys. I managed by following [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-ssh-how-to/) guide.
