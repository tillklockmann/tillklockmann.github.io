## Changing your code editor font - improve your coding experience ?

Fira Code is an open source font, that comes with some ligatures. I like it and it gives your code a nice look even though it is ugly ;)

Check it out [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

If you want to take it even further and are willing to pay for the font, the thing to have seems to be 'Operator Mono'.

Check it out [here](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/operatormono) and a review on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoPe1KXYOtg).

It's only 200 bucks! :->
