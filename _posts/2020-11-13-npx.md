the command ```npx```  is usually like ```npm``` available when you have Nodejs installed. It lets you e**x**ecute **n**ode **p**ackages from the ```node_modules/.bin``` directory.

> Running npx commandname automatically finds the correct reference of the command inside the node_modules folder of a project, without needing to know the exact path, and without requiring the package to be installed globally and in the user's path.

For instance, you can execute wepack like so:

```npx node_modules/.bin webpack```

If you ever run into problems not being able to use a javascript commandline tool directly like @vue/cli, try to execute it with npx:

```npx @vue/cli create my-project-name```
