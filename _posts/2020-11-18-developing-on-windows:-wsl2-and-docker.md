title: "Developing on windows: wsl2 and docker"
---

I currently set up a development environment on windows with wsl2 and docker.

I mainly followed the steps on [docs.microsoft.com/wsl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) updating my windows version, updating the Linux kernel and setting wsl 2 as the default.

I also used these guides by [Fred Gauthier](https://medium.com/@fred.gauthier.dev/web-development-environment-with-wsl-2-and-docker-for-symfony-5860704e127a) and by[John Woodruff](https://dev.to/johnbwoodruff/far-more-epic-development-environment-using-wsl-2-439g).

I set up for a normal user, and it took me a while to get it going. But it works!
